# QGIS AU Snippets
This is your location to access small, reusable pieces of code stored and shared through the platform. 
> Use the "Gist" feature to create them, notify us (via the QGIS AU email list) with the link and then we will subscribe to them - make sure they are public and not secret!

For more information, check out [Creating Gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists).
